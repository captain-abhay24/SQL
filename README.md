*##  E-commerce Sales Analysis using PostgreSQL*

*### Project Overview*

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of 20,000+ sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform using PostgreSQL. It dives deep into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance through complex SQL queries. Real-world business challenges such as revenue drops, product returns, and inventory bottlenecks were addressed using structured data analysis techniques.

*###  Data Cleaning*

To ensure accurate insights, the dataset was cleaned through:
- **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated redundant entries in customer and order tables.
- **Null Handling**: 
  - Critical fields like customer addresses and payment statuses were filled or flagged appropriately.
  - Context-based strategies were applied to preserve data integrity.

---

*###  Handling Null Values*

Contextual methods were used to handle missing data:
- **Customer Addresses**: Assigned default placeholder values where missing.
- **Payment Status**: Categorized as `Pending` if status was null.
- **Return Dates**: Retained as null since not all orders were returned.

*###  Project Objective*

The goal was to demonstrate SQL proficiency through real-world business problem-solving. The analysis focused on:
- Customer behavior trends
- Product and sales performance
- Inventory control and restocking insights
- Payment and shipping timelines
- Return patterns and forecasting

---

*###  Key Business Problems Identified*

1.  Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking  
2.  High return rates in specific product categories  
3.  Delays and inconsistencies in shipment delivery times  
4.  High customer acquisition costs paired with low retention

*###  Learning Outcomes*

This project helped me to:
- Build and work with a normalized relational database schema
- Preprocess and clean large, real-world datasets
- Apply advanced SQL: window functions, CTEs, subqueries, joins
- Perform deep business analysis using SQL
- Optimize queries for large-scale datasets

*##  Conclusion*

This project showcases the practical application of SQL to analyze and solve complex e-commerce problems. From optimizing logistics to enhancing customer retention strategies, the project highlights how structured data analysis can drive business decisions.

Through this project, I’ve gained hands-on experience in cleaning large datasets, writing optimized queries, and deriving actionable insights from raw data—skills that are essential for data-driven roles in business and product domains.
